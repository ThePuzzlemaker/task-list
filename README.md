# task-list

A simple program to track tasks to do regularly. It does not save completed tasks.

Put a list of tasks (separated by newlines) in `~/.task-list` on Linux/Mac/*nix or `C:\Users\<your name>\.task-list` on Windows.

For example, this file will display "Some task 1" and "Some task 2" as needing to be completed when the program is run:

```
Some task 1
Some task 2
```
